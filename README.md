Week 1:

-I just found out that there are many kinds of truth

They are:

1. Legal truth (Judicial system) is decided by a judge or jury based on the allowable evidence presented at trial.

2. Authoritative truth (Business) is specified by a trusted person or organization, or maybe just your boss.

3. Scientific truth is confirmed by experiment but only scientific falsehood can be demonstrated by an experiment—when the experiment fails to behave as predicted.

4. Probable truth is established by statistical analysis of sample data.

5. Philosophical proof involves careful exposition and persuasion typically based on a series of small, plausible arguments.

but our target is most likly to be the probable truth.

-I also found out that word can sometimes be a symbol:

    operator      (symbol)    -usage

1. nagation ( ¬ )        -not

2. conjunction      ( ^ )         -and

3. disjunction      ( v )        -or

4. exclusive or     ( + )         -xor

5. conditional      ( 	→	 )     -if, then

6. biconditional   ( 	↔	 )      -Iff

- I also learn how to use the "Truth Table" which is quite interesting.



Week 2: 

I have learn that in the conditional, thier can be converse and contrapositive of it.

p	→	q

* contrapositive - ¬p	→  ¬q

* converse - q	→	p
