Week 1:

-I just found out that there are many kinds of truth

They are:

1. Legal truth (Judicial system) is decided by a judge or jury based on the allowable evidence presented at trial.

2. Authoritative truth (Business) is specified by a trusted person or organization, or maybe just your boss.

3. Scientific truth is confirmed by experiment but only scientific falsehood can be demonstrated by an experiment—when the experiment fails to behave as predicted.

4. Probable truth is established by statistical analysis of sample data.

5. Philosophical proof involves careful exposition and persuasion typically based on a series of small, plausible arguments.

but our target is most likly to be the probable truth.

-I also found out that word can sometimes be a symbol:

    operator      (symbol)    -usage

1. nagation ( ¬ )        -not

2. conjunction      ( ^ )         -and

3. disjunction      ( v )        -or

4. exclusive or     ( + )         -xor

5. conditional      ( 	→	 )     -if, then

6. biconditional   ( 	↔	 )      -Iff

- I also learn how to use the "Truth Table" which is quite interesting.

- Truth Value as bit where p is T and q is False

Week 2: 

I have learn that in the conditional, thier can be converse and contrapositive of it.

            p	→	q

* contrapositive - ¬p	→  ¬q

* converse - q	→	p

Equivalence	Name

p∧T≡p

p∨F≡p	     ---Identity laws


p∨T≡T

p∧F≡F	     ---Domination laws


p∨¬p≡T

p∧¬p≡F	     ---Negation laws


p∨p≡p

p∧p≡p	     ---Idempotent laws


¬(¬p)≡p	     ---Double negation law


p∨q≡q∨p

p∧q≡q∧p	     ---Commutative laws


(p∨q)∨r≡p∨(q∨r)

(p∧q)∧r≡p∧(q∧r)	     ---Associative laws


p∨(q∧r)≡(p∨q)∧(p∨r)

p∧(q∨r)≡(p∧q)∨(p∧r)	     ---Distributive laws


¬(p∧q)≡¬p∨¬q

¬(p∨q)≡¬p∧¬q	     ---De Morgan's laws


p∨(p∧q)≡p

p∧(p∨q)≡p	     ---Absorption laws

- plus kinds of Quantifiers

*Existential Quantifiers - true if "there exist" at least one true and not if all are false

*Universal Quantifiers - true if all are true and not if one that exist is false


Week 3: 

-I have learn the rule of inference.

they are:

*argument - sequence of statement that ends with a conclusion

*valid -  Tautology meaning it is always true and never false

*fallacy - common form of incorrect reasoning which leads to invalid arguments


For Tautology:

Rules of Inference:

*Modus ponens

*Modus tollens

*Hyopthetical Syllogism

*Disjunctive Syllogism

*Addition

*Simplification

*Conjunction

*Resolution
