**Week 1:**

*-I just found out that there are many kinds of truth*

They are:

1. **Legal truth** (**Judicial system**) is decided by a *judge or jury* based on the allowable evidence presented at trial.

2. **Authoritative truth** (*Business*) is specified by a *trusted person or organization*, or maybe just your boss.

3. **Scientific truth** is confirmed by *experiment* but only scientific falsehood can be demonstrated by an experiment—when the experiment fails to behave as predicted.

4. **Probable truth** is established by *statistical analysis* of sample data.

5. **Philosophical proof** involves careful exposition and persuasion typically based on a series of small, plausible arguments.

but our target is most likly to be the **_probable truth_**.

-I also found out that word can sometimes be a symbol:

    operator      (symbol)    -usage

1. negation ( ¬ )        -not

2. conjunction      ( ^ )         -and

3. disjunction      ( v )        -or

4. exclusive or     ( + )         -xor

5. conditional      ( 	→	 )     -if, then

6. biconditional   ( 	↔	 )      -Iff

*- I also learn how to use the "Truth Table" which is quite interesting.*

*- Truth Value as bit where p is T and q is False*

**Week 2:**

**-I have learn that in the conditional, thier can be converse and contrapositive of it.**

            p	→	q

* contrapositive - ¬p	→  ¬q

* converse - q	→	p

**Equivalence	Name**

p∧T≡p

p∨F≡p	     ---**Identity laws**


p∨T≡T

p∧F≡F	     ---**Domination laws**


p∨¬p≡T

p∧¬p≡F	     ---**Negation laws**


p∨p≡p

p∧p≡p	     ---**Idempotent laws**


¬(¬p)≡p	     ---**Double negation law**


p∨q≡q∨p

p∧q≡q∧p	     ---**Commutative laws**


(p∨q)∨r≡p∨(q∨r)

(p∧q)∧r≡p∧(q∧r)	     ---**Associative laws**


p∨(q∧r)≡(p∨q)∧(p∨r)

p∧(q∨r)≡(p∧q)∨(p∧r)	     ---**Distributive laws**


¬(p∧q)≡¬p∨¬q

¬(p∨q)≡¬p∧¬q	     ---**De Morgan's laws**


p∨(p∧q)≡p

p∧(p∨q)≡p	     ---**Absorption laws**

*- plus kinds of Quantifiers*

**Existential Quantifiers** - true if "there exist" at least one true and not if all are false

**Universal Quantifiers** - true if all are true and not if one that exist is false


**Week 3:**

*-I have learn the rule of inference.*

they are:

* **argument** - sequence of statement that ends with a conclusion

* **valid** -  Tautology meaning it is always true and never false

* **fallacy** - common form of incorrect reasoning which leads to invalid arguments


For **Tautology**:

**Rules of Inference:**

*Modus ponens

*Modus tollens

*Hyopthetical Syllogism

*Disjunctive Syllogism

*Addition

*Simplification

*Conjunction

*Resolution


**Week 4:**

*-I have learn the kinds or methods of proof or should i say proving.*

*as for now these are the methods i have learn this week.*

*Direct Proof

*Proof by Contraposition (Indirect)

*Vacuous and Trivial Proof

*Proof by Contradiction (Indirect)


**Direct Proof** - always assume p to be true then show tha q is also

Next

**Contraposition** - first is to say that not q is true then prove not p is also true

Next

the **Vacuous proof** - show that p is false when p implies q is true so its like not p implies quantity of p implies q or q implies quantity of p implies q

and Lastly 

some part of **Contradiction** - somewhat confusing but if my understanding is correct that assume not p is true then show that not p really ends a contradiction.

**Week 5**

*- I have learned the other kind of proof.*

and they are:

**Proof by equivalence** - by proving statement *biconditionally* that is true in both ways

**Induction** - *first basis true with example  then induction ( another assume then Show that it's really true)* >very tricky

*-he also introduced the _Introduction of summation_.* >just awhile didn't take more than 2 min.

*-Finally the last topic he discussed that is very tricky and kinda learn* >but not sure if its kinda easy to understand though i get what he meant.

**Reursive** -first basis specify the value of function at 0 > didn't quite get what it meant but ok? then recursive step

*recursive step* - give a rule for finding thr its value at an integer from its value at smaller > not sure at this but i kinda did get and kinda not.


**Week 6**

*-I have learn this week was the:*

first - **Recursive Algorithm** > quite not there yet since im still beginning programming

second - **Program Correctness** > this is just like provong that the problem is alwys true by this kinds of style:

**insights** - first show that the correct answer is obtained if it terminates (**Partial Correctness**) then show it or prove it that it *always terminates*

2 proposition - **Intial and Final Assertion**

which goes to the **Hoare Triple** --**p{s}q**

**4 kinds of style**

*rule of inference - p{s1}q ^ q{s2}r = p{s1,s2}r

*conditional Statement - (p^condition){s}q ^ (p^condition)-> q = p{if condition then s}q

*If_Else Statement - (p^condition){s1}q ^ (p^condition){s2}q = p{if condition then s1 else s2}q

-I learn next was the formula of **Geometric Series** - a1/(1-r)

and two kind of series: 

1. Convergent - continuous but countable >i think
2. Divergent - infinite continuity

Next is the ** Power Series** - similar as geometric series - a0/(1-x)

And lastly **Set Theory**

**Set Theory** - is the *unordered colllection of distinct collection*

**Power Set** - a set of sets
