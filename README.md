**Week 1:**

*-I just found out that there are many kinds of truth*

They are:

1. **Legal truth** (**Judicial system**) is decided by a *judge or jury* based on the allowable evidence presented at trial.

2. **Authoritative truth** (*Business*) is specified by a *trusted person or organization*, or maybe just your boss.

3. **Scientific truth** is confirmed by *experiment* but only scientific falsehood can be demonstrated by an experiment—when the experiment fails to behave as predicted.

4. **Probable truth** is established by *statistical analysis* of sample data.

5. **Philosophical proof** involves careful exposition and persuasion typically based on a series of small, plausible arguments.

but our target is most likly to be the **_probable truth_**.

-I also found out that word can sometimes be a symbol:

    operator      (symbol)    -usage

1. negation ( ¬ )        -not

2. conjunction      ( ^ )         -and

3. disjunction      ( v )        -or

4. exclusive or     ( + )         -xor

5. conditional      ( 	→	 )     -if, then

6. biconditional   ( 	↔	 )      -Iff

*- I also learn how to use the "Truth Table" which is quite interesting.*

*- Truth Value as bit where p is T and q is False*

**Week 2:**

**-I have learn that in the conditional, thier can be converse and contrapositive of it.**

            p	→	q

* contrapositive - ¬p	→  ¬q

* converse - q	→	p

**Equivalence	Name**

p∧T≡p

p∨F≡p	     ---**Identity laws**


p∨T≡T

p∧F≡F	     ---**Domination laws**


p∨¬p≡T

p∧¬p≡F	     ---**Negation laws**


p∨p≡p

p∧p≡p	     ---**Idempotent laws**


¬(¬p)≡p	     ---**Double negation law**


p∨q≡q∨p

p∧q≡q∧p	     ---**Commutative laws**


(p∨q)∨r≡p∨(q∨r)

(p∧q)∧r≡p∧(q∧r)	     ---**Associative laws**


p∨(q∧r)≡(p∨q)∧(p∨r)

p∧(q∨r)≡(p∧q)∨(p∧r)	     ---**Distributive laws**


¬(p∧q)≡¬p∨¬q

¬(p∨q)≡¬p∧¬q	     ---**De Morgan's laws**


p∨(p∧q)≡p

p∧(p∨q)≡p	     ---**Absorption laws**

*- plus kinds of Quantifiers*

**Existential Quantifiers** - true if "there exist" at least one true and not if all are false

**Universal Quantifiers** - true if all are true and not if one that exist is false


**Week 3:**

*-I have learn the rule of inference.*

they are:

* **argument** - sequence of statement that ends with a conclusion

* **valid** -  Tautology meaning it is always true and never false

* **fallacy** - common form of incorrect reasoning which leads to invalid arguments


For **Tautology**:

**Rules of Inference:**

*Modus ponens

*Modus tollens

*Hyopthetical Syllogism

*Disjunctive Syllogism

*Addition

*Simplification

*Conjunction

*Resolution


**Week 4:**

*-I have learn the kinds or methods of proof or should i say proving.*

*as for now these are the methods i have learn this week.*

*Direct Proof

*Proof by Contraposition (Indirect)

*Vacuous and Trivial Proof

*Proof by Contradiction (Indirect)


**Direct Proof** - always assume p to be true then show tha q is also

Next

**Contraposition** - first is to say that not q is true then prove not p is also true

Next

the **Vacuous proof** - show that p is false when p implies q is true so its like not p implies quantity of p implies q or q implies quantity of p implies q

and Lastly 

some part of **Contradiction** - somewhat confusing but if my understanding is correct that assume not p is true then show that not p really ends a contradiction.
